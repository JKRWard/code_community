Predator,Habitat,Food and feeding
Diardis clouded leopard," Little is known of its habitat requirements, but long thought to be strongly associated with primmy evergreen tropical rainforesl up to about 2000 m. However recent reports suggest its ecological requirements may be more flexible, with observations of cloudcd leopards in logged forests, degraded secondary forest, scrub habitats and mangrove swamps."," A variety of terrestrial and arboreal vertebrates are reported as prey,but no detailed studies with large sample sizes to date. Prey items known to include young Sambar, muntjac, mouse deer, Bearded Pig, palm Civet, Hoses Langur (Praclmishnswi). ()mngutan (Pongo). porcupine, birds, and fish. The cats long, thick tail, large paws. and short legs suggest it is well suited to an arboreal lifestyle, but the majorityof sightings on Borneo are of Clouded leopards walking on the ground. They are also known to use former or existing logging roads for hunting on Borneo."
Leopard," As might be predicted from its broad geographic distribution, Leopards areable to live in almost every type of habitat. In subSaharan Africa the cats are found in all habitats that have an annual rainfall above 50 mm. They are also found in true deserts, but only where river courses extend into this otherwise inhospitable habitat. In the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park, South Africa, Leopards inhabit aricl,open dune sandveld with scattered shrubs and trees. They escape the intense midday heat by sheltering in porcupine or aardvark burrows. Tracking studies in the Kalahari have shown that Leopards can survive without drinking for as long as ten days. In other hot, dry deserts such as the Namib, Sahara, Sinai, and Arabian, Leopards alsouse caves, burrows, or the shade of dense vegetation to survive daytime temperatures that may reach 70¬∞C. In other parts of Africa Leopards occur in the wetter habitats,including savannas, acacia grasslands, evergreen and deciduous forests, and scrub woodlands. They also occur in the rain forest habitats of Central and West Africa,where annual rainfall typically exceeds 1500 mm. Leopards are common throughout the Indian subcontinent, from the moist deciduous, teak, and shola forests of theWestern Ghats to the dry, deciduous, bamboo, and mixed forests of the rugged ta-ble land in central India. In the north they live in sal forest and the tall grasslands onthe outwash plains of the Himalaya as well as in the mountainous terrain of Pakistanand Kashmir to 5200 rn. In Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, and java the cats are found in dense, primary rain forest and a variety of other forest types. In the Russian Far East Leopards inhabit mountainous forested regions. They prefer broken topography with Korean pine and second growth oak forest. In this area, a key limit-ing factor is snow depth. The cats prefer habitats where the average longterm snowcover does not exceed 15 cm. Whatever type of habitat they live in, Leopards are oftenable to persist in close proximity to people, as long as they are not persecuted and have access to secure den sites. Remarkably, three Leopards were discovered living in an abandoned engine at the railroad station in Kampala, Uganda. In India it is not uncommon to read newspaper accounts of villagers finding leopards hiding in shedsand outbuildings"," Leopards are adaptable generalists, able to survive on an extraordinary variety of large or small prey. In many areas the cats diet consists largely of small to medium sized mammals (5‚Äî45 kg), but even ungulates weighing two to three  timesthe cats body weight are occasionally taken. Leopards can also survive on extremely small prey, an ability that allows them to live in areas from which larger prey has long since been extirpated. The cat has a truly catholic diet, taking an incredible variety of different prey sizes and types. At least 92 prey species are known from the Leopardsdiet in subSaharan Africa. Where Leopards live near Villages their diet often includes dogs, cats, sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. A large number of sheep or goats can b ekilled in a single incident when a Leopard finds itself in a pen with a frightened flock.The Leopards fondness for dogs is well known and there are many accounts of family pets or Village dogs disappearing in the night. Food habit studies from different partsof the Leopards geographic distribution illustrates the cats adaptability. In the Ser-engeti, Impala (Aepycems melampus) and Thompsons Gazelles (Eudorcas thomsam'i) are the principal prey, but other bovids (Bushbuck Tragelaphus scÔ¨Çptus, Common Reed-buck Redunca redunca, Blue Wildebeest Connochaetes tau‚Äôm‚Äônus, Grants Gazelle Nangm‚Äúgranti, Topi Damalz'scus kOMgum, Hartebeest Alcelaphus buselaphus) are also taken. Less frequently taken prey incude Common Warthog (Phacochoerus africarnrus), Burchells Zebra (Equus burchelliz'), hyrax, spring hare, baboons, birds, and small carnivores. lmpala are also the dominant prey (78% of kills) in Kruger National Park, although the cats occasionally prey on other bovids (Bushbuck, Reedbuck, Blue Wildebeest, Water-buck Kobus ellipsiprymnus, Kudu ?lagelaphus stre/Jisrmns, Nyala 7'? angaszfi, Common Tsessebe Damalz'scus lunatus, Common Eland 'lhmvtmgus myx, Sable Antelope H ippotm-guy nlz'ger, and African Buffalo Sym'erus caÔ¨Ç√©r). In the Kalahari, Springbok (Antidon'asmarsupialis) is the most important prey (65% of kills), but duikers, Steenbok (Raplzim'usra‚Äôm/Jestrz's), Blue Wildebeest, Hartebeest, and Gemsbok (Oryx gazella.) are also taken.Incidental prey included small carnivores, birds, rodents, Cheetahs, Aardwolves, and aardvarks. Duikers were the most important prey in north-east Namibia; Steenbok ranked second. A variety of other carnivorous animals were also killed, including Aardwolf, Cheetah, Genet, Bateared Fox, Wildcat, and python. A major difference in the diets ofAfrican Leopards is that. cats from tropical rain forests take significantly more primates. In the lturi Forest, Zaire, primates comprised  25% of prey items in Leopards eats. ()I' 13 species of diurnal anthropod primates in the area. remains of at least. eleven species were identified in seats. Arboreal guenons, mangabeys. and colobines were taken in proportion to theie abundance but predation on lhoests monkey a terrestrial species was much greater than expected based on their availability. Despite the increased percentage of primates in the diwts of ituri forest leopards their principal prey was meduim sized ungulates in the tai national park ivory coast prinate remains were found in 25% of scats leopards killed at least eight spacies of primate dikiers were tie dominant prey  but bushpigs porcupines hyrax water echevrotain and rodents were also taken. Leopards in Asiapreylargely on small to medium sized ungulates In Nugurhulc National Park.india  chital muntjac and sambar were found in 65% of scats the remains of guar and four horned Antelope('li'lmrmm qumlrirmvlix). Wild Boar: and chevrotain were found in 19% ()1 scats, incidental prey included primates, hares. porcupines. and Dhole. The small (15‚Äî20 kg)muntjac was thedominant prey (43%) in Huai Khzi Khaeng Wildlile Sanctuary.thailand. Primates ranked second (11%) in scats. followed by porcupincs (10%). Less frequently occurring prey intluded Sambar. Wild Boars. Hog Badgers, pangolins. rodents. birds. lizards. and crabs. in Wolong Resolve, China, Tufted Deer ([t'lap/zmlus re¬ªllhlllo/l/HM) are the principal prey (41 %)l Musk deer. Sambar, Wild Boar and several species of bovids (Serow (Iaprimrm‚Äòs. Takin Budmms taximlm: Goral Naemorhedus) were taken occasionally. Surprisingly. rodents were the second most frequently occurring prey (17%) in scats. The remains of a Red Panda and a Giant Panda were each found in a scat in the Russian Far East more than half of the Leopard's dict consists of siberian Roe Deer Secondary prey include Siberian Musk Deer, Sika Deer,Wild Boar, hare.badger. Raccoon Dog. and pheasants. Leopards locate their prey primarily by sight and sound. and they spend considerable time looking and listening for prey as they walk slowly about their home ranges Having detected an animal, [11C Leopard will stalk it,preferring to get as close as possible before launching an attack. Alternatively. it will lie in ambush. waiting for the prey to come close enough to attack, Adult prey are rarely pursued. although young inexperienced animals are sometimes chased for consideraable distances. Most hunting is done at night, taking advantage of the cover of dark-ness. and what little information is available suggests hunting success is higher at night.Leopards occasionally hunt during the daytime, but typically only in areas with dense cover. Few people have actually observed Leopards trying to capture an animal In Kruger National Park. Leopards were unsuccessful on thirteen daytime attempts but two attempts at night were both successful. In the Serengeti National Park, only one ofnine and three of sixtyfour daytime attempts to Capture prey were successful. Like other large felids. Leopards Commonly kill large prey with a bite to the throat. Small prey are usually dispatched with a bite to the nape or back ()fthe head. Leopards go to great lengths to avoid losing their kills to scavengers and larger predators. They will drag carcasses hundreds of meters to get to areas with dense cover or to cache kills intrees. Hauling 21 carcass into a tree involves a great feat of strength, One Leopard managed to haul a 125 kg giraffe calf up into a tree to a height 0157 m, The habit of caching kills in trees appears to be more common in africa .wherc large carnivores such as lions and hyenas will quickly steal kills from the smaller and less powerful leopard. in the Serengeti. Leopard kills Stored in trees lasted about four timeslonger than similar sized kills stored on the ground. How often a Leopard kills depends on variables such as size of prey, seasonal Changes in cover, individual differences in levels ofexperience.and reproductive constraints. Leopards in Kruger National Park killed on average about one Impala per week. The longest interval between kills of large prey was 19days. In the Serengeti, where Thompson‚Äôs Gazelles were the principal prey, Leopards made a kill about every five to six days. A female Leopard in South Africa‚Äòs Londolo/iGame Reserve was seen with 28 kills weighing more than 10 kg in 330 days. or about one kill every 11-8 days. The kill rates in Kruger were slightly higher in the wet seasonthan in the dry season, which was thought to be related to the increased density ofstalking cover following the onset of the rains. Males in Kruger killed a large prey animal about once every 7.2 days compared to once every 76 days for females without young. In the Kalahari Desert, male Leopards made a kill about evely three days. com-pared to once every 1.5 days for females with cubs. As the interval between kills got longer, Leopards in the Kalahari increased the distances they traveled each day to in-crease contact rates with prey. F emales in north-east Namibia without young made akill about once every 5‚Äî5-6 days, whereas females with dependent young made a killevery 3-9‚Äî4-4 days. Although the kill rate was not much higher for females with young.they did kill larger prey, resulting in a greater per capita food intake. The amount of meat consumed varies, depending on the size of the prey, how much meat is lost to scavengers, and the percentage of carcass that is inedible. Estimates of consumption vary from 4-7‚Äî3-1 kg/day for adult male Leopards in Kruger to ‚Äò19 kg/I‚Äôday for adult females in the same area. Leopards in captivity are maintained on about 1 -2 to 2-6 kgday, but they surely have less caloric demands than animals in the wild."
Tiger,"Tigers are found in a great variety of habitat types. In Turkmenistan. uzbekistzm, and Tajikistan the Tiger was found in the drainage basins of rivers and hikes.where they hunted in the tugai which consists of thickets of Iowstature trees (tumu-ga. tamarisk), shrubs, and dense reed beds. In Kazakhstan Tigers sometimesascended into montane forests in the summer in pursuit Of wild Boar, attaining heights 012500111. There are also records of Tigers in the Himalayas at altitudes of almostt 4000 al-though in most areas the cats remain well below 2000 m. In China they occupied grass thickets, montane subtropical evergreen forests, and mixed forests dominated by oakand poplars. Tigers in the Russian Far East live in low mountainous terrain dominated by nut pine, birch, oaks,fir, and spruce. Winter in this region is harsh, with deep snowand temperatures dropping to ‚Äî34¬∞C. In Sumatra and Malaysia Tigers are found in lowland humid tropical rainforest, where precipitation exceeds 2000 mm annually. In the outwash areas south of the Himalayas Tigers inhabit theterai beltof floodplain habitat dominated by marshes, swamps, oxbow lakes, and tall, dense grasslands intermixed with riverine forest. Sal forest, a climax form of moist deciduous forest. occurson the slopes of the adjacent hills. In India Tigers inhabit the tropical. wet evergreen.and semievergreen forests of Assam, the mangrove swamps Of west Bengal and neigh-boring Bangladesh, the vast expanses of dry deciduous forest in the central plateau.the tropical moist and dry deciduous forests of the Western Chats, and the thorn for-ests of Rajasthan and Gujarat. In Ranthambhore National Park, Rajasthan, Tigers alsouse the ancient temples and fortresses as places to lie up during the day. ",". The list of prey species found as kills or in Tiger scats (form) is extensive, but across its vast geographic range the Tigers dict consists largely of deer  and pigs. Over at 54 year period in Sikhote‚ÄîAlin, Russia, Red Deer ( Cm‚Äòuus emplzus) and Wild boar were dominant prey, representing 437 of 522 kills (84%), Minor prey included Moose (Alas glues), Siberian Roe Deer (Capreolm pygargus), and Sika Dom ((ImmsNippon). Siberian Musk Deer (Moschus nwschiferm), and Longtailed Coral (N(mnor/mLus t‚Äòuudalus). Surprisingly, the kill records included a small number of adult Brown andAsiatic Black Bears There is little information available on the food habits of Tigers inSouthEast Asia, but in a sample (n 2 38) of Tiger scats from Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctumy Thailand, muntjac were the dominant prey (42%). Sambar Deer (7%) andWild Boar (9%) occurred relatively infrequently in scats, whereas smaller prey such as porcupincs, Hog Badgers, primates, and lizards collectively occurred in 28% of scats. Thc diet of Tigers in Royal Bardia National Park, Nepal, was reconstructedfrom an ananalysis of 215 scats collected over a 5-year period. Three species, Chital (szs (mix),Wild Boar, 21nd Hog Deer (Axis pmoinus), contributed more than 90% 0f the biomass consumed. Several other species, including langur monkeys. Nilgai (Bowlaphus (mgr)-mmÔ¨Çlus). and Barasingha (Rucmms duvaucelz‚Äôz), and porcupine occurred infrequently in scats. Larger ungulates such as the Nilgai and Barasingha wcrc not killed preferentially, probably due to their low densities. Wild Boar were taken out of proportion to their availability, although Tiger predation was heaviest on teo incredibly abundant(over 2OO/km3) Chital Based on an analysis of 472 scats, Tigers in Nagarhole NationalPark, India, preyed selectively on the largest prey available, the Guar (BOA fronmlz's')and Sambar, whereas smaller prey such as Chital, Red Mumjac (Muntiarus mxmdjak).and Wild Boar were underrepresented in the diet  Thesefive prey species together provided about 96% of the biomass consumed by Tigers. Among the larger prey species, Tiger predation was biased towards adult male Sambar, Chital, and Wild Boar :and young Gaur. Minor prey identfied in scat included Indian Spotted chevrotain (Alaschiola), hare, porcupine, Dhole, and primates Based 011 the scat data, the average Weight of prey taken by Tigers in Nagarhole was 91 kg. In contrast,the average weight based solely on kills was 400 kg; however, because large kills are more likely to be found, this method grossly overestimates the average weight of preytaken it does indicate, however, that Tigers are capable of taking extremely large prey. including adult male Gaur that may weigh 1000 kg‚Äò Tigers are solitary, stalk and ambush hunters and they actively search for prey. Habitat fcatures that attract ungulates. such as water  holes and the edges of small clearings, are favorite hunting spots. Stalking cover is important: a Tiger will attempt to get as close as possible to its prey before making a final rush, relying on quickly overtaking prey rather than pursuit for long distances.The tiger catches hold of the. prey with its claws and holds and kills its prey with a bite from the large canine teeth. Small prey, or those weighing half that of the Tiger, are typically killed with a bite to the nape, with the canines separating the vertebrae and breaking the spinal cord. Large prey are most often killed with a throat bite, leading to strangulation or neck breakage due to twisting on impact. Except. for adult guar,Tigers in Nagarhole killed their prey where cover density was significantly higher than that of leopard kills. Adult Gaur were killed in areas with significantly less cover, sug-gesting that attacks on Gaur in dense cover were extremely risky. Tigers in Nagarahole also took advantage of the cover of darkness; about 27% of kills were made between()6200‚Äî0900 h and the remainder were made between 18:00‚Äî06:00 h. Large kills suchas Gaur may be too heavy to be moved, but if there is insufficient cover at the kill site the Tiger will drag its kill to an area where it feels secure before beginning to feed.Drag distances may be a few meters or several kilometers, and individual temperament may also influence this behavior. Feeding usually begins on the hindquarters or rump and once the body cavity is opened the stomach is removed and set aside. The carcass is then dragged a short distance before feeding resumes. Tigers use their carnassial or blade-like Cheek teeth to slice off large hunks of meat and the rough tongue is used to rasp flesh from bones. The amount of meat consumed can be substantial: one adult male Tiger in Chitwan ate 32 kg in a single night and there are other reports of Tigersconsuming 20% of their body weight in a nights feeding. Tigresses in (Jhitwan spentan average of three days with each kill and during that time consumed 46 kg of meat.However, even large kills may not last long if several Tigers are feeding on the carcass.For example, a tigress in Chitwan and her two large young fed on an adult Sambar fortwo days, consumingI  kg of meat or about 17 kg per Tiger per day. Tigers often rest near the carcass, feeding intermittently, but if the Tiger leaves it will typically cover the remains. raking leaves, grass, dirt, or even rocks over the carcass. There is little infor-mation on kill rates, but tigresses in Chitwan without dependent young killed a large prey animal about every eight or nine days, which translates to 40 to 46 kills per year.Females with dependent young have to kill more often or kill larger prey to meet the nutritional demands of growing offspring."

African Wild Dog,". Wild Dogs occupy a range of habitats including shOI‚Äòt‚Äîgrass plains,.S(‚Äô.ml‚Äî(i(‚Äò.SCrL bushy savannahs, and upland forest. Early studies in Tanzania Serengeti led to a beleif that Wild Dogs were primarily an open plains species, but they reach thelr highest densities in thicker bush (e.g. central Tanzania, western Zimbabwe and northern Botswana). Several relict populations also occupy dense upland forest (e.g. Harenna Forest. Ethiopia; Ngare Ndare Forest, Kenya). Wild Dogs have been recorded in desert,although they appear unable to expand into the southern Kalahari or into montanehabitats; they occur in some lowland forest areas. It appears that their current distribution is limited primarily by human activities and the availability of prey, rather than the loss of a specific habitat type.",". Wild Dogs mostly hunt medium‚Äîsized antelope. In most. areas theirprincipal prey arc Impala, Greater Kudu (ngelaphus strepsz‚Äòceros), Thomson‚Äôs Gazelle,and Blue Wildebeest (Co-nnochaetes taurinus). They will give chase to larger species,such as Common Eland (Tragelaphm oryx) and African Buffalo (Syncerus cajfer), butrarely kill these species. Warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.), dik-diks (Madoqua spp.), Steen-bok (Raphicems campestris), and duikers ((Zephalophini) are important prey items insome areas. African Wild Dogs also take small prey opportunistically, such as hares,lizards. and bird eggs, but these make a very small contribution to their diet. AfricanWild Dogs live and hunt in packs. Hunts appear to be highly coordinated and are oftenpreceded by a ‚Äúsocial rally‚Äù. During chases, Afn'can Wild Dogs may run at speeds of upto (30 km/h, and are specially adapted to cope with the heat stress that this involves.Alter one dog has made the Ô¨Årst. grab of an antelope or other prey Species, other packmembersjoin and help drag the quarry t0 the ground.

In winter, ptarrnigan and grouse (Lagopus spp.) are common prey, inaddition to rodents and Reindeer. Changes in Fox populations have been observedto follow those of their main prey in three- to Ô¨Åve‚Äîyear cycles. Foxes living near ice-free coasts have access to inland prey and also sea birds, seal carcasses, Ô¨Åsh. and in-vertebrates connected to the marine environment, leading to relatively stable foodavailability and a more generalist strategy. In late winter and summer, foxes foundin coastal Iceland feed on seabirds (Un'a aalge, U. lomvia), seal carcasses, and marineinvertebrates. Inland foxes rely more on Ptarmigan in winter, and migrant birds, suchas geese and waders, in summer. In certain areas, foxes rely on colonies of arctic geese.which can dominate their diet locally.

Bat-eared Fox," In southern Africa prime habitat is mainly shortgrass plains and areas. with bare ground, but foxes are also found in open scrub vegetation and and or semi-arid shrub land and open and savannah. The range of Bateared Foxes overlaps almost completely with that of termites of the Hodotermes and Micmhodotermes genera thatprevail in their diet. In East Africa Bat‚Äîeared Foxes are common in open grasslandand woodland boundaries, but not on short‚Äîgrass plains. Those areas occupied by Bat-eared Foxes usually contain more harvester termite (H. mossambicus) foraging holes and dung from migratory ungulates where beetles are likely to be found.",". Insects are the primary food sources in open grassland and wood‚Äîland edge habitats. Harvester termites and beetles are typically the most commonlyconsumed prey items. Diet is supplemented by orthopterans, beetle larvae, and ants.In open shrub savannahs, arachnids and fruit (consumed seasonally) may be amongthe more common food items. Small mammals, birds, eggs, and reptiles are eatensporadically in southern Africa, but rarely in eastern Africa. There is seasonal variationin the proportion of particular taxa consumed: in the Serengeti dung beetles are themain source of food during the rainy season, when termite activity is reduced. Whenboth beetles and termites are scarce, Bat-eared F oxes will dig up beetle larvae from theground. Harvester termites and dung beetles are more abundant in areas inhabitedby clusters of Bat‚Äîeared Fox families, and local differences in H. mossambicus densityare inversely related to territory size. Although Fox water requirements may be metby the high water content of their insect prey or by berries during the summer, wateris nevertheless a critical resource during lactation. Groups forage as a unit. Foragingtechniques depend on prey type, but food is often located by walking Slowly, noseclose to the ground entl ears cocked forward. _Prey is detected mostly by sound andoften excavated by dlggmg. Foraging and‚Äòfeedmg rates are higher when feeding ontermite patches than on more dispersed insects. When feeding on termite patches.group members feed closely together, but when feeding on beetles, beetle larvae 0rgrasshoppers, they can forage up to 200 m apart."

Blackbacked jackal preferentially use either open grassland (when sympatric with Side-stripcdjackal) or wooded savannah (when sympatric with Golden and Sidestriped jackals). In western Zimbabwe. habitat partitioning was mediated by aggressive encounters in which Black backed jackals displaced Side striped jackals from grassland habitats",". Generalist feeders. Diet varies according to food availability. Whenthe jackals occur in sympauy with other carnivores using the same prey base, foodresources are partitioned. Dietary items typically include small- to medium‚Äîsized mam-mals (e.gi murids, spring hares. young ungulates), reptiles‚Äò birds and bird eggs, carrion,and human refuse, as well as invertebrates and plants. In coastal areas, Black‚Äîbackedjackals will eat beached marine mammals, seals, Ô¨Åsh, and mussels. Invertebrates suchas termites and insects are also commonly eaten. Pairs and small groups are oftenseen foraging together. Groups ofhetween eight and ten aggregate at large carcasses0f herbivores, and more than 80 have been recorded at seal colonies on the NamibDesert coast. Such aggregations are accompanied by aggressive behavior between ter-ritorial individuals. However, in the south-westcrn Kalahari, where antelope carcassesare uncommon. groups of up to 15 pairs can feed in succession without much overtaggression.

Black footed cat," Inhabits dry, open savanna, grasslands, and Karoo semi-desert (savanna biome) with sparse Shrub and tree cover with a mean annual rainfall of between 100‚Äî500mm annually; absent from the driest and sandiest parts of the Namib and Kalahari Deserts. Seems to avoid rocky terrain and bushy country. Presence of South African Spring Hare burrows and 7hnemz'termes termitaria for shelter may be crucial since 98%of I84 resting places in central South Africa were in abandoned South African Spring Hare burrows. In some areas frequently uses hollowed out termitaria; hence the common name anthilI-tiger Also rests under rock slabs. ",". Opportunistic carnivore, taking everything it can overpower. Of seven stomachs collected in Botswana four contained murid rodents, three spiders,and one each elephant shrews, reptiles, insects, and birds. In central South Africa 43 vertebrate prey species identified. 14 mammal species comprised 72% of the total prey mass consumed. Most important, with 39% of prey mass, were murids; 21 species ofbirds (26%), mainly larks, with eggs of various species taken; eight species of frogs and reptiles (Gekkonidae, Scincidae, Colubridae) ; prey up to the size of hares, mongooses and pigeons, sand grouse, and bustards taken. A minimum of ten invertebrate species were eaten, some as small as the alates of harvester termites. Average prey size is 24 g.In central South Africa on average males kill larger prey; the smaller and more agile females are more successful in catching small birds. In summer both sexes concen-trate on abundant small rodents. In winter a higher proportion of larger (over 100 g)birds and mammals are taken. Three different hunting styles identified  fast hunt ""when moves in swift bounds at 1‚Äî2 km/ h trying to flush prey from cover;slow hunt involving a slow stalk at an average speed of 05‚Äî0-8 km/h, while looking and listeningcarefully; and sit down, waiting at a rodent den system for up to two hours. About70% of the night is spent moving. Birds are sometimes snatched from the air. Hunt-ing success very high, about one vertebrate prey animal caught every 50 minutes and10‚Äî14 rodents or small birds caught per night, representing 200‚Äî300 g of food or about 20% of the body weight; record intakes can reach 450 g per night. Excess food is cached and scavenged readily. Independent of water but will drink occasionally when water is available."

Bobcat,"Throughout its range, uses a wide variety of natural habitats. These rangefrom coniferous and deciduous forest in Maine to brushlands in Oklahoma. to mlnnd hardwoods in Louisiana, semi-deserts in Arizona and New Mexico. humid tropical forests in Florida, dly scrubland and forests ofpine and oak in Mexico. mountainous terrain in Oregon, mixed mesophytic forests of the Cumberland Plateau. and prairies in eastern Montana. They can also inhabit human-altered landscapes such as agricultural lands, if suffiÅcient cover exists nearby. Generally prefer rugged. kay land-scapes with dense cover. Prey density is the most important factor influencing habitat selection. However, other factors affecting habitat selection include protection from severe weather, availability of den sites, adequate cover for hunting and escape. andlow human disturbance. Females will establish natal dens in small thickets, hollow trees, brush piles, stumps, and rootmasses from fallen trees."," Like most felids, use dense cover to stalk prey or to conceal themvselves t0 ambush their prey. Although they feed on a diverse army of species. lagomorphs are commonly utilized throughout the speciesù range. cottontails and Snow-shoe Hares are the two lagomorphs most commonly eaten. Generally select small tomedium-sized prey (0-7‚Äî5-5 kg), but they will kill prey as large :15 WhiIetailed Deer especially in northern climates during winter. Usually kill deer by stalking a resting animal, pouncing 0n the back and head, and repeatedly biting the Victims throat However, most use of White-tailed Deer results from the opportunistic discovery of carrion. Ultimately, the kind of prey utilized is dependent upon geographic location In Florida, Eastern Cottontail (SylvilagusÔ¨ÇoÔ¨Ådanus), Marsh Rubbil (S.

Canada lynx ," A variety of forest types  within the broad belt of boreal forest that stretches from Alaska to Newfoundland, They are also found in theconiferous forests of the northern Cascade Mountains of washington and the rocky mountains of north east Utah and Central colorado at elevations above 2700 in, Prey almost exclusively on Snowshoe Hare and thus the habitats used by the cat coincide With habitats where hares are abundant. especially early successional fire dependent fotests, Mature forests containing tangles of blown down trees and stumps are often used for denning sites  in areas where coexists with Bobcats and Coyotes, appears to avoid possible conflicts by using areas at higher elevations and areas with greater snow depth"," Prey extensively on Snowshoe Hares, but their abundance is Cyclic and densities can vary enormously during the 8‚Äî1 1 year cycle. Snowshoe Hare numbers may reach 2300 per km2 one year and then plummet to as few as 12 per km: a few years later. Regardless, Snowshoe Hares contribute 60 to 97% of the Lynx‚Äòs diet and insome areas the cat hunts little else. On Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, for example.198 01200 attempts to capture prey involved Snowshoe Hares. Squirrels and grouse appear as incidental prey in the winter. The appearance of Moose and Deer in scats is probably related to feeding on Carrion, since ungulates do not figure prominently inthe cat‚Äôs diet. Summer diets are more diverse and typically include a greater number of small birds and rodents, but even then Snowshoe Hares contribute more than halfof all meat consumed. Different methods are employed to Capture prey depending on environmental Conditions. In Newfoundland, when Snowshoe Hares were abundant. about 60% 0f kills were made from ambush, but this method was not effective in Alberta, Canada, when Snowshoe Hare density was low. Neither active searching nor ambushing Snowshoe Hares was more effective during a low in their numbers in theYukon, but hunted more Often from ambush, presumably because this method is more energy efficient when prey are scarce. In an area in southern Yukon with relatively high Snowshoe Hare densities and dense vegetation, Canadian Lynx had little success ambushing Snowshoe Hares These findings suggest that hunting success is more dependent on stalking conditions than on Snowshoe Hare densities or habitat type Indeed, even in areas with abundant Snowshoe Hares but where the vegetation is particularly dense, Canadian Lynx may be more successful hunting in open areas where Snowshoe Hare densities are lower. Based on tracking animals in snow. Canadian lynx kill one Snowshoe Hare per day or one every other day, but Capture success is variable the Yukon, when Snowshoe Hare numbers were increasing, a Canadian Lvnxmade six kills in eleven attempts (546%). However, when Snowshoe Harenumbers were low the success rates varied from 20‚Äî22%. The highest hunting suceess ratesare achieved by groups one  study reported that the success rates for groups of one. two.and 4 averaged 14%. 17%, 38%) and 55%), respectively In the Yukon, female-  killed Snowshoe Hares more frequently than did smgle cats, but the return per individual was lower. However, in groups comprising accomplished hunters, the returnper individual was higher than that of single animals. Hunting success is also related to the distance between the Canadian Lynx and Snowshoe Hare when It begins to run.Results from several studies show Canadian Lynx leaping 1-5 to 2-5 m per jump, and Canadian Lynx were generally more successful the fewer jumps they had to make. In contrast, a study on Cape Breton Island showed that Canadian Lynx made an average of l l-ljumps (covering 24 111) per successful capture compared to 8-4jumps (cover.ing 163 m) for unsuccessful captures. Snowshoe Hares are sometimes eaten where killed and sometimes taken to another site, which may be Close by or some distanceaway. Canadian Lynx on Cape Breton Island initially opened the thoracic cavity ofHares and then fed on the organs, followed by the shoulders and neck. The stomach and intestines were not eaten, nor were the paws. Canadian Lynx consume an esti-mated 600 g to 1200 g per day, which is equivalent to from one Snowshoe Hare evenother day to one per day. Uneaten parts of kills may be cached, covered with leaves or snow, or left uncovered at the site. Caching behavior was related to hunting success;few kills were cached when Snowshoe Hares were diffiÅcult to catch. The impact ofpredation on Snowshoe Hare populations depends on where their populations are inthe cycle. Studies in Alberta, Canada, estimate that Canadian Lynx account for 20% ofwinter losses during a low in the Snowshoe Hare cycle, but during a peak the impactwas negligible. ‚Äô"
Cape Fox,". Mainly Open country, including grassland with scattered thickets and light-ly wooded areas, particularly in the dry Karoo regions of South Africa, the Kalahari Desert, and the fringes of the Namib Desert. Also in lowland fynbos in the WesternCape, as well as agricultural lands, where the foxes lie up in surviving pockets of natu-ral vegetation during the day and forage 0n arable and cultivated fields at night. Along the eastern flank of the Namib Desert in Namibia, they occupy rock outcroppings and inselbergs, ranging out onto bare gravel plains at night. In Botswana, they have been recorded in Acacia scrubland, short grassland, and especially on the edges ofshallow seasonal pans, as well as cleared and overgrazed areas. In the central Karooof South Africa they occupy the plains as well as low, rocky ridges and isolated rock()utcmppings. In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, they have been recorded at elevations ‚Äòof 1000‚Äî1500 m",". The Cape Fox consumes a wide range of food items, includingsmall rodents (murids), hares, reptiles, birds, invertebrates, and some wild fruits. Ananalysis of the contents of 57 stomachs collected across western and central SouthAfrica and Botswana showed that rodents were the most commonly eaten mammalprey; beetles (larvae and adults) and grasshoppers comprised the majority of inver-tebrate intake. Birds and reptiles are occasionally included in the diet, but are prob-ably less important. The largest wild prey species recorded are hares and spring hares.Cape Foxes will also scavenge and occasionally take young lambs and goats. Foragingis solitary, although foxes may occasionally gather in loose groupings to forage at anabundant food source. They obtain their prey mostly by digging rapidly with theirfront paws, often preceded by periods of intent listening. Caching of prey is common-"

Caracal," Caracal are found in dry woodlands, savanna, acacia scrub, hilly steppe, andarid mountain areas to 2500 m. They do not live in true desert or dense tropical rainforest. They are often associated with edge habitats where forest and grassland meet,and though they use open grasslands at night, they require access to bushes and rocksfor daytime rest sites",". Caracal generally take prey that weigh less than 5 kg, includinghares, hyrax, small rodents, and birds. They will, however, take larger (over 15 kg) prey if the opportunity arises. In two studies in South Africa‚Äôs Mountain Zebra National Park, hyrax were found in 53 and 60% of seats, and Mountain Reedbuck were found in eleven and 20% of seats, respectively.

Dhole,". Dholes are found in a wide variety of vegetation types, including primary, sec-ondary, and degraded forms of tropical dry and moist deciduous forest; evergreen and 'semi-evergreen forests; dry thorn forests; grassland scrub forest mosaics; and alpine 'steppe (above 3000 m). They are not recorded from desert regions. In India, tropical dry and moist deciduous forest may represent optimal habitats, based on the regions thought to hold the largest Dhole populations. Ungulate biomass, particularly that of cervid species, is highest in these vegetation types when compared to others in the :same region. Important factors that may influence habitat selection include the availability of medium to large ungulate prey species, water, the presence of other large car-nivore species, human population levels, and suitability of breeding sites (i.e. in termsof proximity to water, presence of suitable boulder structures, and sufÔ¨Åcient prey)",". Diet includes beetles, rodents, birds, and occasionally grass andother plants like many other canids. However, Dholes hunt mainly vertebrate prey.with a preference for medium to large ungulates. They are also known to scavengeand occasionally have been observed eating carrion (e.g. Asian Elephant (Elephas max-z'mus) and Gaur (Box frontalis) carcasses). It has been suggested that such scavengingonly occurs during periods of prey scarcity, particularly during the dry season. Grassis ingested, but may serve an anti‚Äîhelminthic function rather than a nutritional one.Dholes are communal hunters, occasionally forming packs of over 30 animals, but aremore often found in hunting groups of fewer than ten animals. Depending on preyavailability, Dholes may also hunt alone or in pairs, taking smaller prey such as deerfawns or hares. During hunts, some Dholes may lie in ambush while others drive preytowards them. Dholes often drive deer into water, where they swim out to surroundand capture them. It is Common for certain individuals to take particular roles in theilurit, such as ieading the Chase or taking the Ô¨Årst grab at the prey."

Ethiopian Wolf,"A very localized endemic species, conÔ¨Åned to isolated pockets of Afro‚Äî alpine grasslands and heath lands, where they prey on Afro‚Äîalpine rodents. Suitable habitats are above the tree-line, from about 3200 to 4500 m, with some wolves present in mon-tane grasslands at 3000 m. However, subsistence agriculture extends up to 3500‚Äî3800In in many areas, restricting the wolves to higher ranges. Rainfall at high altitude varies between 1000 and 2000 mm/year, with one pronounced dry period from December to February/March. Wolves utilize all Afro‚Äîalpine habitats, but prefer open areas withshort herbaceous and grassland communities where rodents are most abundant, alongÔ¨Çat or gently sloping areas with deep soils and poor drainage in parts. Prime habitats in the Bale Mountains are Characterized by short herbs (Alchemilla spp.) and grasses, and low vegetation cover, a community maintained in continuous succession as a result ofEthiopian African Mole Rat (Tachymyctes macmcephalus) burrowing activity. Other good habitats include tussock grasslands (Festuca spp., Agmstz's spp.), high-altitude shrubs dominated by Helichrysum spp., and Short grasslands in shallow soils. In northern partsof the range, plant communities Characterized by a matrix of ‚Äúguassa‚Äù tussock grasses(Festuca SP9), ‚ÄúcherenÔ¨Å‚Äù bUShCS (Eu'ryops pinifolius) and giant lobelias (Labelia.

Ericaceous mom‚Äò-lands (Erica and PÔ¨Åz‚Äôllipia spp.) at 3200‚Äî3600 m are of marginal value, whereas 0P6‚Äùmoorlands contammg patches of herbs and grasses offer relatively good habitat. "," lithiopian Wolves [‚Äòeed almost exclusively upon diurnal rodents ofUN high‚Äîaltitude i‚ÄîUi'o-alpine grassland community. In the Bale Mountains, diurnalrodents accounted {or 96% of all prey occurrences in feces, with 87% belonging tothree Bale endemic species: the Ethiopian African Mole Rat (300‚Äî930 g), Blick‚Äôs GrassRat (Amimnt/u's blirki), and the BlaCk-Clawed Brush-furred Rat (Lophummys mdanonyx).Other prey species include the Ethiopian Vlei Rat (Otomys typus), Ethiopian Buff-spot-ted Brush-furred Rat (Laphummys Ô¨Çavapunctatus), Ethiopian Highland Hare (LP/NMstarcki), and occasionally goslings and eggs. On occasion, wolves were observed feed‚Äîing on Rock Hyrax (Procavia capensz's), and young of Bush Duiker (Sylvicapm gmnnu'a).Common Reedbuck (Redunm 'redunca), and Mountain Nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni).Sedge leaves (Carex monostachya) are occasionally ingested, probably to assist digestionor control parasites. Where the Ethiopian African Mole Rat is absent (i.e. Gaysay mon-tane grassland in Bale and Menz), it is replaced in the wolf diet by the smaller North-east African Mole Rat (Tachymyctes splendens). Similarly, in northern Ethiopia Amaran‚Äîtlzis abyssz'nicus and LophummysÔ¨Çavopunctatus replace their respective endemic relatives(A. blickz' and L. melanonyx) from Bale. Elsewhere, 0. typus, a rare prey item in Bale andMenz, was identiÔ¨Åed as the commonest prey in droppings collected in the other Ô¨Åvepopulations. The same study conÔ¨Årmed that wolves are specialized hunters of diurnalrodents throughout their distribution, but that there is also some degree of variationin diet composition along climatic-induced gradients. Although the Ethiopian Wolf isprimarily a solitary rodent hunter, it can also hunt cooperatively. Occasionally, smallpacks have been seen Chasing young antelopes, lambs, and hares and makingr kills.Ethiopian Wolves will take carrion or feed on carcasses; in fact, a sheep carcass is themost successful bait for attracting wolves. The local name ‚Äújedalla farda‚Äù‚Äîthe horse‚Äôsjackal‚Äîrefers to wolves‚Äô habit of following mares and cows about to give birth so theycan eat the afterbirth. In areas of grazing in Bale, wolves were often seen foragingamong herds of cattle, a tactic that may aid in ambushing rodents out of their holes, byusing the herd as a mobile hide. Wolves carefully explore rich food patches by walking810W1)! and pausing frequently to investigate holes or to localize the rodents by means0f their excellent hearing. Once the prey is located they move with short, stealthy stepsalternating with short periods of immobility, sometimes with belly pressed flat to thegmund.

Fennec Fox," Fennecs subsist in arid desert environments. Stable sand dunes are believed to be ideal habitat, although the foxes also live in very sparsely vegetated sand near the Atlantic coast. Annual rainfall is less than 100 mm per year on the northern fringe of the Fennec‚Äôs distribution. On the southern fringe, it may be found up to theSahelian areas that receive as much as 300 mm rainfall per year. In the Sahara, sparse vegetation is usually dominated by An'stz'da spp., and Ephedm alata in large sand dunes.On small sand dunes, it is dominated by Panicum turgidum, Zygophyllum spp., and some-times by trees like Acacia spp. and Cappan's decidua.",". Fennecs are omnivorous, consuming insects, small rodents (e.g.jarulus jarrulus, Gerbillus spp., and Meriones spp.), lizards (e.g. Acanthodaclylus spp.),geckos (e.g. Stenodactylus spp.), skinks (e.g. Scincus albzfascz'atus), eggs, small birds (e.g.larks and sandgrouse), and various fruits and tubers. Fennecs hunt alone. They havenot been seen using the ‚Äúmousejump‚Äù hunting strategy typical of most fox species,but reportedly dig to Ô¨Ånd insects and small vertebrates. Like other foxes they cachefood by burying it."

Dingoes are found in all habitats from tropical alpine moorlands totropical wetlands and forests to arid hot deserts.",". Extremely variable, but main prey consists of large ungulates(Moose Alces sp., Reindeer Rangifer tarandus, deer, Wild Boar Sus scmpha, etc.). GrayWolves will also eat smaller prey items, livestock, carrion, and garbage. In winter, theyhunt in packs, but in summer they hunt singly, in pairs, or in small groups. Chasesranging from 100 In to more than 5 km are the rule. Generally Gray Wolves end upwith, or tend to select, Older individuals, juveniles (under 1 year) or debilitated ani-mals, or those in otherwise poor condition. Average daily food consumption variesfrom 2-5‚Äî6-3 kg or more per day, and kill rates vary accordingly.

Iberian lynx," Generally, most abundant in areas of high habitat diversity, particularly in amosaic of open forest mixed with extensive dense brush or shrub. In Donana NationalPark in south-west Spain, consistently prefer Mediterranean  scrubland habitat over all other habitat types they also use ash stands but avoid pine and eucalyptus plantations not unexpectedly the two preferred habitats contained the highest densities of rabbits the cats main prey more than 90% of daytime rest sites are in thick heather scrub the presence of permanent water sites and relatively low disturbance by humans are also important components of high quality habitat",". Feed almost exclusively on European Rabbits (Oryctolagus amicu‚Äîlus); unlike Eurasian Lynx, which is principally a predator of small ungulates. In Donna National Park, rabbits contribute 75 to 93% 0f the diet, but in other areas their diet includes a few other taxa. Fawns andjuvenile Fallow Deer and Red Deer form a minorpart Of the diet in fall and winter, and a variety of small murid rodents, snakes, and lizards are also occasionally taken. Also prey on birds, principally ducks and geese, and red-legged partridge (Alecton‚Äòs rufa). In DonÅana hunt mainly in the open pastures and scrub forest edge between the scrublands and marshes. Kill rabbits with a bite to thebase of the skull. Deer are killed by suffocation, with one or more throat bites. Deer  kills are dragged into dense cover where they provide food for a single Lynx for several days. Like many other cats, they attempt to conceal kills by raking leaves, soil, and oth-er debris over what remains of the carcass. In captive feeding trials the maintenance diet for a male is estimated at 912 Kcal/day compared to 673 Kcal/day for a female.Feeding solely on rabbits could satisfy these energy requirements with 379 rabbits/yearfor males and 277 rabbits/year for a non reproducing female."

Indochinese clouded leopard," Usually associated with primary evergreen tropical raintorest, but little is known of its habitat requirements. Based on a relatively small number of locations visited by two radio collared Indochinese Clouded Leopards in Thailand, the cats preferdense primary evergreen forest. In south Nepal a subadult male was captured in dry woodlands, radiocollared and relocated to a nearby national park. During the. ten days it was followed it used L211] grasslands and hill forest. In other parts of their geographic range there are anecdotal accounts of Indochinese Clouded Leopards using relatively open, dry tropical forest, secondary and logged forest, and mangrove swamps. ","A variety of terrestrial and arboreal vertebrates are reported as prey,including porcupines, Bearded Pigs (Sus barbatus), young Sambars (Rum unimlor),muntjacs (A/Iumz'arus), mouse deers (Tragulus) , and palm civets.

Island Fox,"Present in all habitats on the islands, including native perennial and exotic European grassland, coastal sage scrub, man'time desert scrub, Coreopsz's scrub, Isocomascrub, Chaparral, oak woodland, pine woodland, riparian, and inland and coastal dune.Generally not found in areas highly degraded by human disturbance or overgrazing.Recently, Foxes have become scarce owing to precipitous population declines. On thenorthern Channel Islands declines are principally a consequence of hyperpredationby golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos); on those islands the foxes are more numerous inhabitats with dense cover",". Island F oxes are omnivorous and feed on a wide variety of insects,vertebrates, fruits, terrestrial molluscs, and near‚Äîshore invertebrates. The relativeabundance of insects, mammals, and plant material in the diet has been found todiffer by habitat type, and by island, depending upon availability of food items. Forexample, N orth American Deermouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) occur at high densitieson San Miguel Island, where they constitute a large proportion of Fox diet.

They may occasionally be found in arid areas, but typically only where watercourses penetrate this drier habitat jaguars avoid open forest and grassland habita tbut are commonly found along the edges of forest Openings. ","jaguars are opportunistic predators, capable of killing almost amprey they encounter. The cats powerful jaws and robust canine teeth enable it to kill livestock weighing three to four times its own weight, often with a bite to the back ofthe skull, rather than the more common neck or throat bite employed by other large cats. The canines are also strong enough to penetrate the hard shells of large turtles and the thick hides of crocodilians. More than 85 prey Species are listed in the cats diet. In the seasonally flooded savannas of Venezuela jaguars preferred Capybam(Hydrochoerus hydrocham's) and Collared Peccary (Peczm' tajacu), but they also preyed on White-tailed Deer (Odocoilws virginianus), caiman, freshwater turtles and turtle egg(Chelidae, Pelomedusidae), tortoises, iguanas, and cattle. Collared Peccary, agout'Land large turtles also formed the bulk of the Jaguars diet in the lowland tropical foest of Manu National Park, Peru.jaguars in Iguagu National Park, Brazil, fed mainlyon Collared Peccary, White-lipped Peccary ( Tayassu pecam'), Brocket (Mazama) and white tailed Deer; minor prey included coati, agouti, marsupials, armadillos, rabbits.Paca (Cum'culus paw), squirrels, birds, reptiles and primates. In the Cockscomb Basis of Belize armadillos were the single most important prey, occurring in half of all jaguar feces. Three-toed sloths (Bradypus) and iguanas were the prominent prey items in thejaguar‚Äôs diet in La Selva, Costa Rica. In the Paraguayan Chaco, small and medium-sized mammals, principally Brocket Deer, rabbits, armadillos, and marsupials were impor-tant prey. Although jaguars are especially fond of peccaries, the cat‚Äôs basic diet tends to reflect the relative abundance of the various prey species in an area. In areas where native ungulates have been depleted and forest habitats converted to pastures for demestic stock,jaguars subsist to a large extent on cattle.

Medium- to large-sized ungulates make up the bulk of their diet but lions are generalists taking a large variety of vertebrates from mice to young rhinos hippos and african elephants birds up to the size of an ostrich as well as reptiles fish and even insects major large ungulate species include a large varaiety of bovids like african buffalo blue wildebeest hartebeest waterbuck kob sable antelope gemsbok eland impala springbok as well as giraffe warthog and zebra in africa and deer as well as a high percentage of livestock in asis individual differences in prey selection and killing techniques are discernible in different prides in the same area indicating that learning plays a strong role in the lions hunting behaviour ie hunting of brown fur seals on the namibian coast in the serengeti 30% of stalks were successful when members of the pride took part against 17-19% when only a single individual was involved lions do not take account of wind direction when stalking prey however they will often try to cut prey off by running ahead of it. speeds of 45-60km/h may be achieved in a rush for up to a few hundred meters usually no more than 100-200 the attack delivered to the rump or shoulders with the weight of the Lions often bringing the prey to the ground. Sometimes the preys neck is broken in falling. As soon as the prey is down it is seized by the throat or muzzle to effect strangulation. The Lions feed at the site of the kill or drag it 10 the nearest cover. The belly is ripped open and the stomach and intestines pulled out. Lions, especially males, frequently scavenge, acquiring up to 53% of food items in the open plains of the Serengeti this way. This figure decreases to 5% in more arid environments, where prey occurs at lower density. However, in the woodlands ()i~Kruger National Park, male Lions acquire most of their food by hunting rather than scavenging. In Kruger the main prey of male Lions was African Buffalo; fenmles fed onthe most abundant medium‚Äî sized ungulates, such as Blue Wildebeest and Burchell‚ÄòsZebra. Lions will watch vultures descending on kills of other predators. Protection of kills against Spotted Hyenas, is greatly enhanced by the presence of a male. F(‚ÄòIU'dlCSmay lose up to 20% of their kills to Spotted Hyenas and a further 17% t0 unrelated Lions. In the absence of their normal prey, Lions can cause grave losses to cattle and small stock, or may even become maneaters. The individuals involved are not alway old and decrepit."
Long nosed mongoose,"Foundhin [brests near swamps, streams, and streambecls.

F luctuations in rodentavailability had no effect on the occurrence of shrews in the diet. Among eight CO-existing carnivores in the Central African Republic, Long-nosed Mongooses had thesecond highest niche breadth. In Nigeria, two stomachs contained a centipede, a snail,and some remains of fruits and berries. Long-nosed Mongooses are said to carry snailsto a particular spot and to break them by throwing them backwards with the forepawsagainst a tree or a rock."
Maned Wolf," Favors tall grasslands, shrub habitats, woodland with an open canopy cerrado"", and wet fields (which may be seasonally flooded). Some evidence indicates thatthey may prefer areas with low to medium shrub density. Maned Wolves are also seenin cultivated areas and pastures. Daytime resting areas include gallery forests, cerrado.and marshy areas near rivers. There is some evidence that they can utilize cultivatedland for hunting and resting, but additional studies are essential to quantify how wellthe species tolerates intensive agricultural activity. ",". Omnivorous, consuming principally fruits and small- to medium-wed vertebrates. Numerous studies document a broadly varied diet of C. 50% plant mtl c. 50% animal material. The fruit Salanum lymcarpum grows throughout much ofthe range and is a primaiy food source; other important items include small mammals((Zaxiidae. Muridae, Echimydae) and armadillos (Dasypodidae), other fruits (Annon-aceae. Myrtaceae, Palmae, Bromeliaceae, and others), birds (Tinamidae, Emberizidae,and others), reptiles, and arthropods. Although the frequency of plant and animalitems found in fecal samples is approximately equal, the biomass of animal items isusually greater than that Of plant items. Certain items, such as rodents and Solanum,are consumed year round, but diet varies with food availability. At least occasionally,Pampas Deer (Ozotoreros bezoartz'cus) are also consumed. In one study, deer occurredin 24% of 1673 fecal samples analyzed. Strategies for hunting animal prey includestalking with a Ô¨Ånal pounce, digging after burrowing animals, leaping into the air tocapture flying birds and insects, and sprinting after fleeing deer. Approximately 21%of all hunting attempts end with the successful capture of prey, and the strategies donot differ in their success rates. Maned Wolves have been recorded feeding on Coyputhat were caught in traps set by hunters, and have been observed scavenging oppor-tunistically 0n road-kill carcasses."

Birds such as tinammts and guans are also taken, as are amphibians, reptiles, insects and fruit. Most prey IS nocturnal and arboreal, but also hunts 0n the ground. Agile Climbers and leapers and can Climb down a tree trunk head first and hang by their hindfeet from a branch.Several anatomical adaptations allow them to perform these acrobatics: they can pro-nate and supinate the hindfeet, allowing them to grip a branch equally well with theirhind forefeet; and their broad, soft feet provide a good platform for jumping and an effective gripping surface for climbing. Limited information from the wild supports the notion that they do much of their hunting above the ground."
Marsh mongoose," Coincident with riparian habitats, such as swampy and streambed areas. InDmnga‚ÄîSztngha forest, Central African Republic, restricted to swamp forest adjacent tostreams.

Opportunistic, with diet dependent upon prey availability. MarshMongooses are sympatric with Spotted-necked and African Clawless otters and there issome overlap in diet, but this species is less dependent upon aquatic prey. Prey compo-sition differs between areas. In South Africa, the most frequent food types eaten variedacross seven regions, but overall the frequency of prey types (as percentage composi-tion in seats) was: Crustacea (23%), Insecta (17%), Mammalia (13%),Amphibia (9%),Mollusca (8%), and Aves (8%).

In the Central African Republic, the most abundant prey types (asfrequency of occurrence in seats) from a rainforest study were: Coleoptera (86%),Amphibia (82%), Orthoptera (74%), and Crustacea (67%). Marsh Mongooses foragealongside or in shallow water. They are excellent swimmers, but do not swim readily.They reach into cracks, mud, and rocks with their forelimbs to search for prey, andstand up and use their forelimbs to throw hard‚Äîshelled prey items, e.g. crabs or mussels,downwards against rocks. Some prey, e.g. crabs, snakes, and large rodents, are seized inthe jaws and Ô¨Çicked sideways prior to being given a killing bite. Small crabs are eatenwhnle; larger crabs are turned upside down, the foreclaws are bitten off, the meateaten, and the carapace discarded. Upturned carapaces 0n riversides indicate the pres‚Äîence of Atilax (otters normally crunch up the crab carapace). Marsh Mongooses areextremely dexterous compared to other herpestids.

This diversity of habitats might suggest that they are habitat generalists, but close monitoring of radio-collared animals indicates they are highly dependent on dense ground or forest cover. Indeed, they occupy a much narrower range of microhabitats than would have been predicted by their wide geographic distribution.ocelots often rest during the daytime in brush piles, clumps of vines in trees, among the roots of large trees, under tree falls, and even in concrete culverts. Recorded fromsea level to about 1200 m",". Primarily on terrestrial, nocturnal rodents weighing less than 1kg. The small rodents include rice rats, cotton rats, marsh rats, Black Rats, cane mice.pocket mice, and Spiny rats.

Pampas Fox," The. Pampas Fox is a typical inhabitant of the pampas grasslands of SouthAmerica's Southern Cone. It prefers Open habitats, tall grass plains and subhumidm (113' habitats, but is also common in ridges, dry serublands and open woodlands. In drier habitats in the southerly and easterly parts of its range, the species is replaced bythe South American Gray Fox.here its range overlaps with that of the Crab eating Fox, the Pampas Fox selects more open areas. Apparently it has been able to adapt tothe habitat alterations caused by extensive cattle breeding and agricultural activities.",". Like most other medium‚Äîsized foxes, the Pampas FOX is a general-ist and adaptable carnivore. Its diet shows great geographic variation and may includeboth wild and domestic vertebrates (particularly rodents and birds), fruit, insects, car-rion, and garbage. Based on stomach contents, wild mammals and sheep appearedto be the two most common food items in Uruguay, while in La Pampa Province,Argentina, European Hares and rodents were the most common food items, followedby birds and carrion. In Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, there was a high frequencyof rodents and birds, but also of insects, fruits, and crabs. Seasonal and local varia-tions in diet are likely connected to variations in food availability. The Pampas Fox isa solitary and opportunistic carnivore. Large, highly concentrated food resources (ie.large mammal carcasses) may cause several individuals to gather, possibly beyond theborders of normal home ranges. Food caching behavior has been observed, appar‚Äîently related to an increase in the availability of rodents."
Pousargues mongoose," Savannah‚Äîforest mosaic, montane forest grasslands, and the thicketed shoresof Lake Albert. Said to rest in holes in trees and termite mounds.",. The digging claws and unspecialized teeth suggest that the dietmay include fossorial invertebrates and small burrowing vertebrates.
Puma," The Puma is usually associated with remote, rugged terrain where there is cover for stalking and ambush-hunting, secure places to establish natal dens, and at least one species of abundant deer-sized prey. It has been suggested that Viable populationsof Puma are impossible without at least one species of deer sized prey. Its extensive dis-tribution throughout the Western Hemisphere, from sea level to more than 4000 m elevation, suggests a tolerance of environmental conditions that is rare among mammals.Habitat use can be highly seasonal where prey species such as Elk migrate altitudinal in response to snowfall, or can be annually static, for example, in subtropical southeiast florida, where prey species have stable annual home ranges. Specific habitat preferenc-es are as variable as the regions in which the Puma lives, and range from mixed Conifer and curleaf mountain mahogany vegetation in rugged topographyin wyoming to subtropical hardwood hammocks, pineflatwoods and palm forests in southern florida female puma locate decretive natal dens in boulder piles dense vegetation of other natural structures that provide some protection from the elements and reduce detection by potential predators. In Florida these sites tended to be at least one km from a paved road, and were usually located within dense thickets of saw palmettowhich provided vertical cover, horizontal cover, and reduced temperaturescompared to  outside air where the species is dependent upon forest, occupied areas tend to be at least 20,000 ha without major roads. The Species increasingly is found  in landscape patches that have been fragmented by expanding human activity andinfrastructure such as highways, ranches, produce farms, human settlements, and extractive industries, In these areas, remnant landscape Connections and restored habitat corridors can be  important demographic linkages. In Florida and California dispersing individuals are tolerant of habitat that may include canals, highways, relatively open terrain. and other features that are usually recognized as barriers by resident adults.",". The Pumas extensive distribution is reflected in a diverselist of prey: In general, Puma from temperate Climates eat larger prey than Puma from tropical climates, and solitary adults tend to eat larger prey than females with kittens the smaller prey size ofPuma in the tropics may be the result of niche separation with the larger, socially dominant jaguar. Puma are ambush hunters; they utilize cover toclosely approach potential prey before an attack is made. Common prey in North america include Elk, White-tailed Deer, Mule Deer, Wild Boar, Collared Peccary, porcupine rabbits, and hares. In South America common prey include vichaza guanco( [m.vwguanizop), brocket deer, Pampas Deer (Ozotocerox bezoartiws), pudu (P141114)agouti ,armadillo, and porcupine. Domestic stock is occasionally taken throughout the species range, and exotic species such as Wild Boar and European Hare can be important dietary components even where larger prey are available. In marginal habitat such as in the Everglades of southern Florida, atypical prey such as alligator (Alligutm mumsipiensis) and North American River Otter may be taken. This is the result of inhert-ly low populations Of Whitetailed Deer in the Everglades region. Puma routinely remove the entrails of large prey before caching and burying their kills with leaves and other debris for future use. The use of such kills may last from one to 27 days, Humans ( L1Halter the abundance and spatial use patterns of Puma and their prey through huntingand other activities. Historically, Puma predation on humans has been rare. although in recent years there has been an apparent increase in encounters. espet'iullx muilvingjuvenile or underweight cats. Many of these attacks have occurred in the urban rwilderness interface where the likelihood of an encounter increases with presence of humans in occupied peripheral Puma habitat."
Raccoon Dog," Typically found near water, and during autumn, habitat selection appears to be affected by reliance on fruits and berries. In Japan, Raccoon Dog habitat includesdeciduous forests, broad-leaved evergreen forests, mixed forests, farmlands, and ur-ban areas from coastal to subalpine zones. In the countryside, the species prefers herbaceous habitats and is less likely to use Cryptamm‚Äòz'a plantations throughout theyear, although riparian areas are often used. In urban environments, Raccoon Dog sinhabit areas with as little as 5% forest cover. In the Russian Far East, they avoid dense forests in favor of open landscapes, especially damp meadows and agricultural land. In the introduced range, Raccoon Dogs favor moist forests and shores of rivers and lakes,especially in early summer. In late summer and autumn they favor moist heaths with abundant berries. In the Finnish archipelago, however, they prefer barren pine forests,where they feed on crowberries (Empetmm nigmm)",".F 00d and F ceding. Raccoon Dogs are omnivores and seasonal food habits shift as foodavailability Changes. In most areas small rodents form the bulk of their diet in all sea-sons. Frogs, lizards, invertebrates, insects (including adults and larvae of Orl/wptem,COZeO/Jtem, Hemiplem, Di/Jtem, Lepz‚Äôdaptem, Odonata), and birds and their eggs are alsoconsumed, especially in early summer. Plants are eaten frequently; berries and fruitsserve as an important and favored food source in late summer and autumn, when Rae-Coon Dogs decrease their food intake before entering winter dormancy. Oats, sweetcorn, watermelon, and other agriculture products often are found in Raccoon Dogstomachs. Carrion, Ô¨Åsh, and crustaceans are consumed when available. As opportun‚Äîistic generalists, Raccoon Dogs forage by searching Close to the ground and may alsoclimb trees for fruits. They mainly forage in pairs, usually wandering some distancelrom each other."

Red Wolf,"Very little is known about Red Wolf habitat because the Speciesù range was  reduced by the time scientific investigations began. Given their wide. historical distribution Red Wolves probably utilized a large suite of habitat types at (me time. The last naturally occurring population utilized the coastal prairie marshes of south-westen Louisiana :tiid south-eastem Texas. However, many agree that this environment prob-ably does not typify preferred Red Wolf habitat. There is evidence that the species was found in highest numbers in the. once extensive bottomland river forests and swamps  of the South-east. Red wolves reintroduced into North Carolina, and their descendants,have made extensive. use of habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to pocosins,which are fbrest/wetlund mosaics with an understory ofevergreen shrubs. This suggests that Red Wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey popu-lations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight. This generalization is sup-ported by one study in which low human density, wetland soil type, and distance fromroads were the most important predictors of potential wolf habitat in North Carolina ",". Mammals such as Coypu (Myorastor coypus), rabbits (Svlm'lag'us spp.).zmd rodents (Sigmodon Inspidus, Oryzomys paluslm, 0ndalm zibethirus) are common inmuth-eastem Texas and appear to have been the primaiy prey of Red Wolves histori-(‚Äòaliy Presently in North Carolina, \Nhite‚Äîtailed Deer (Odocoileus iliÔ¨Ågimanus), NorthernRaccoons, and rabbits are the primary prey species for the reintroduced population(86% 0f the diet).

Sechuran Fox, Occupies a Variety Of habitats ranging from sandy deserts with low plant den-sin to agricultural lands and (113‚Äô forests. F ew details of habitat preferences are. Known,". The Sechuran F 0x is a generalist Olnnivore that preferentially con-sumes vertebrate prey or carrion when available, but often depends predominantly 011seeds or seed pods. Feces collected during late winter and early spring in the inlandSechuran Desert contained mainly the remnants of undigested seeds or seed pods 0falgarrobo (PmsopisjulfÔ¨Çom), zapote (Cappan's scabÔ¨Åda) and vizcacho (C. avicen‚Äôrzifolm).The syrupy matrix surrounding the seeds may be the actual source of nourishment.In a germination experiment, seeds recovered from feces sprouted earlier than thosegathered from the ground, suggesting that the foxes not only act as seed dispersers,but affect the ability of the seeds to germinate rapidly when sporadic rains occur. Foxdroppings along the coast contained crabs and several bird species. Following E1 NiÔ¨Åorains, fox droppings revealed a dramatic dietary shift to grasshoppers and mice (Par‚Äî alomys gerbillus) as these prey became more abundant. In central Peru, the main sum‚Äîmer foods were insects, scorpions (Can'm candicans), fruits, and rodents. The lack ofstanding water in the inland desert habitat suggests that the foxes can survive withoutdrinking. However, they may lick condensation from vegetation on foggy mornings.No food caching has been recorded."

Snow leopard," Snow Leopards inhabit rugged and remotemountainous areas where the terrain  is broken by steep cliffs ridges. and ravines. The cats habitat is typically high rocky areas. alpine meadows. alpine steppe scrub. and high altitude forests. they generally spend the summer above tree line at elevations of 2700 to 6000m, but in winterdeep snow often forces wild ungulates to move to lower elevations and the Snow Leopards follow. The cats have also been found in isolated mountain massifs in mongolia.and to reach these sites they would have had to traverse 20 to (3:3 km of broad. flat,open terrain.",". Snow Leopards are capable of killing prey as much as three timestheir own weight. A large percentage  of their diet. consists of mountain-dwelling sheep and goats. Major prey species include bharal (llwudnis), Himalayan Tahr (Hmnz'lmgmjemlahirus), Markhor (Capra falmnm‚Äòz'), Siberian lbex ((Ia/Im .s'z'bi'nm), Argali (0111's (1m-mnn), and Urial sheep (Owls orz'mmlis). In some areas wild asses (Equus), musk deer  Wild Boar (Sm 5170/21). and gazelles are also taken. Smaller prey such as marmots, pikas,hares and rabbits, pheasants, and voles are important food items, especially in summer. One estimate suggests that as much as 45% of the meat in a Snow Leopard's summer diet may come from marmots. The cat also preys on domestic sheep, goats, cows,horses, yaks, and dogs. An unusual amount of vegetation, especially twigs of myricaria and tamarix bushes (Tamaricaceae), have been found in Snow Leopard seats, suggesting that these cats deliberately eat plant matter. Snow Leopards hunt by walking animal trails, ridge lines, river terraces, and the beds of deep gorges. They usually avoid open, unbroken terrain. When hunting, they tend to attack from a vantage point above the prey and have been seen pursuing prey across slopes and down mountain-sides in Chases of 200‚Äî300 In. Prey are killed with a bite to the nape or the throat. Carcasses are often moved to avoid attracting the attention of crows and vultures. The cat will remain with the carcass for 3-5 days, or until only bones remain. Captives require about 1.5 kg of meat per day and in the wild an adult blue sheep will provide the cat with food for a week. Females rearing young require about three times the normal amount of food to rear two to three young. One female and her two cubs consumed an adult Bharal in less than 48 hours; a similar sized kill would sustain a single Snow' leopard for 3-5 days. T ."

Swift Fox,"Predominately short grass and mixed-grass prairies in gently rolling or level terrain. In Kansas, Swift Foxes have been found to den and forage in fallow wheatfiÅelds. Survival rates between foxes in grassland and cropland sites were not signifiÅcantly different, suggesting that Swift Foxes may be able to adapt to such habitat in somecases. The distribution and density of dens are considered important components ofSwift FOX habitat requirements, particularly in terms of evading Coyote predation orRed Fox competition.",". Swift Foxes are opportunistic foragers, feeding on a variety of mam-mals, but also birds, insects, plants, and carrion. Leporids have been reported as aprimary prey item in several studies. In South Dakota, mammals accounted for 49% ofprey occurrences, with BlaCk‚Äîtailed Prairie Dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) as the primaryprey item. In Kansas and Nebraska, murid rodents were the most frequently occurringprey. Insects also present, but likely to constitute only a small portion of biomass. Birdsand their eggs are also consumed, as are plant materials, including prickly pear cactusfruit, wild plums, and sunÔ¨Çower seeds, which are consumed relatively frequently butmost often in relatively small amounts.

Wildcat,". In Africa, Wildcats are found in 21 variety of habitat types from sea level  to about 3000 m, but appear to be absent from tropical rain forest and from areas that receive less than 100 mm of annual rainfall. Some cover for hunting and rest sites may be important, but cats in Ngorongoro Crater were seen to use the open grasslands. where they rely on holes dug by other animals to escape from larger carnivores. In botswana wildcats  were seen at night in Open woodlands and grasslands. In Zimbabwe‚Äòs HwangcNational Park, the cats were more commonly seen in drier woodland and scrub habtats than in areas close to water, A radio‚Äîtagged Wildcat in Kenya was frequently located in woodlands and grasslands; riverine forest and agricultural lands wereinfrequently used. Wildcats in Israel prefer open Mediterranean forest in hilly areas The  wildcat also occurs on the outskirts of villages and towns, thus bringing it into contact with domestic cats. Wildcats in Asia inhabit thickets of acacia maytenus capparis tamarix and prosopsis in the desert in western Rajasthan, India; in Pakistan the cats are sparsely distributed in the desert regions of south-west Baluchistan and scattered throughout the dryer hilly regions on the western bank of the Indus. In Turkmenistan, Tajikistan,and Uzbekistan these cats live in tamarisk, saxaul, and salwort thickets and shrub vegetation . In Kazakhstan, Wildcats are found in the bush and reeds fringing lakes and rivers; in the foothills of the Tian Shan Mountains they use bushy areas up to 2000 m Wildcats use natural caves for shelter or excavates their own burrows. In Europe wildcats are typically found in broad-leafed and mixed woodlands, particularly in mainland Europe. Coniferous forest use is probably marginal. They are also found in mediterranean maquis scrubland, riparian woodland, and along the edges of marshes and coasts(but not in marsh edges and coasts in Scotland). They avoid very high mountains,exposed coasts, and intensive agricultural, urban, and industrial habitats. and are notfound where snow covers more than 50% 0f the terrain, is more than 20 (‚Äò11) (I001), 01 'remains for 100 days or more each year. Where large‚Äîscale deforestaton hasoccurred in Scotland), Wildcats have adapted to living in the foothills of mountains and on moorland where rough grazing occurs, and are often associated withforest and cropland They require some kind of cover to lie up in when inactive. Forestry plantations may provide important habitat in the early stages. They are frequently seen huntingr ingrasslands adjacent to woodland in Europe. ",". Murids rodents are the dominant prey in most areas in Africa,although larger prey such as spring hares, rabbits, and possibly young antelope are sometimes taken. May also be serious predators of poultry. In Zimbabwe and Botswa-na about three quarters of all stomachs examined contained murid rodents. Birds,principally doves, quail, and weavers, ranked second. Incidental prey included lizards,skinks, and snakes. In a semidesert area of Botswana a common prey identified instomachs was hunting spiders (Solifugidae). In the Namib Desert the remains of small mammals were found in more than 90% of scats; insects occurred in 70% of scats. Similar percentages of small rodents and insects were found in Wildcat feces from Karoo National Park, South Africa. In the Sahara Wildcats were seen 15 km from the nearest waterhole, suggesting they can do without drinking water. In Asia the cats feed principally on rodents, but will take other prey opportunistically, including insects,lizards, snakes, birds, and are known to raid domestic poultry pens. The prey along theIli River, Kazakhstan, consisted largely (81%) of hares, muskrats, gerbils, House Mice,and jerboas. In western Rajasthan, the Wildcats diet was largely jirds (Muridae) and hares, but it was also seen hunting a variety of ground foraging birds (doves, partridge.sandgrouse, peafowl, pigeons). Snakes, including cobras, sawscaled Vipers, and sanrlboas were also killed, as were geckos, scorpions, and large beetles. In mainland europe Wildcats feed predominantly on mice and voles, but in Scotland, rabbits and other lagomorphs are by far the most important prey (up to 70% by frequency in the east Studies in Scotland have shown that predation on birds, especially game birds, is insignificant. Primarily terrestrial hunter, but can Climb well if pursued. They may hunt  in trees for rats inflooded forest in Caucasus. Hunt either by waiting in ambush for prey,e.g., outside rabbit burrows, or hunt opportunistically when patrolling home ranges.Moving slowly and quietly along trails and paths, looking and listening for prey. Once prey is detected, creeps forward, patiently, using every piece of cover to get as close as possible before making its attack. Prey seized with the Claws and pinned to the ground,or held with the paws until the killing bite delivered. Prey may be cached either by hiding it under vegetation, in holes and trees, or by covering it with debris."
